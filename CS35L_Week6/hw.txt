//Homework Week 6

1. Suppose other teams had been observing...

The data is encrypted so even if other teams have been reading our bytes, they
wouldn't be able to understand the data. 

If the other team tapped my keyboards and observed keystrokes, our data would
not be compromised because the only thing we type when actually sending files
is the public key. Should we have actually typed data, then our data would be
compromised.

If the other teams had physical control of the USB they have the highest level
of attack...they literally have our private key. They can decrypt anything
between me and the receiver. A weakness of our team is that we let them have
physical access in the first place.

2. Explain why the gpg --verify command in the following instructions doesn't
really verify that you personally create the tar file in question. How to fix?

gpg --verify can only verify integrity of document that was sent. It doesn't
work like a certificate does. An attacker can just use a public key to sign
as a different person. 

To approach this problem, we need a certificate-like mechanism. A third party
should be able to keep track of who the public key actually belongs to.
