For homework, we had to publish the patch that we created in the lab

I first created my new branch called quote
> git checkout v3.0 -b quote

Next, I applied the patch that I got from the lab
> patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

I ran into a problem here when I tried to patch my current git directory...
it seemed that git thought I had already patched the files so it asked if
I wanted to revert the patch. To continue with the homework, I just 
redownloaded another diffutils directory and patched that new directory
I copy pasted my quote-3.0-patch.txt into this new directory and it worked.

All 6 files were patched.

Now I changed into my source directory, and I opened one of the modified
.c files in emacs. I created a changelog with the EMACS command Ctrl-x 4 a
I entered in all 6 files that were changed and added a brief description on
how they were modified

Now I commited changes to the new branch
> git add .
> git commit -F <Changelog File>
The above command created the commit with the Changelog File as the message

It tracked down my name and email as the Committer

Now I had to create a formatted patch so other people could get my changes
> git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

To test this patch (since I didn't have a partner at the time) I simply created
a new branch 

> git checkout v3.0 -b temp
> git am < formatted-patch.txt

Now I build the system:
> ./boostrap
> ./configure
> make
> make check

I initially had a problem with using bootstrap because I didn't have my PATH 
variable set correctly so I just used the export command shown in lab4.txt

To check if my Changelog entry works, I used the following commands
> make distdir
> cd diffutils*

I then looked at the ChangeLog file and indeed, I see the message that I left
when originally creating the formatted-patch

For the final part the program, I had a problem with GUI that Lauren helped me
fix. After that, I navigated the /~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and I ran the command
> gitk
