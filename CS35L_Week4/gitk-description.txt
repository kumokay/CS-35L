Here, I'm looking at the gitk window depcting a visualization of
Professor Eggert's GNU Emacs git repository. 

The top left subwindow gives information about the structure of
the repository. It shows where the HEAD is, where the master
branch is, and a series of commits that were made.

The subwindow directly to the right of that gives information
about the committer's name and email address.

To the above subwindow's right gives the timestamp of the commit

Right below the top left subwindow there's a small input text box
that holds the commit SHA. 

Below that holds information on the selected commit. This includes
the name and email of the committer, timestamp, and parent and child
commits. 

Below the information subwindow, there is the file changes subwindow
which shows what changes were made to the repository in diff format

Finally, to the right of the diff subwindow is a subwindow that shows
the files that were impacted by the selected commit.
