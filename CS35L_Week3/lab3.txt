first I downloaded coreutils-7.6 with the command wget with the url
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

then I untar and unzipped it
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I made a directory called coreutilsInstall in home directory
mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall

I navigated into my coreutils-7.6 directory (in current directory)

Then I ran the script configure and changed path to install
./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/scotts/coreutilsInstall (absolute path)

I first compiled by typing 'make'
Then I typed 'make install' to install in the coreutilsInstall folder I made

Now my task was to reproduce the bug: If I go to my coreutilsInstall directory
and run the command './ls -l' I see that the old unix bug is still there

Then I needed to apply the patch. I first opened vim and copy pasted the given
patch into a file I called mypatch
Then I ran the command 'patch -p1 < mypatch'
Since in the patch it said in the beginning ---a/src/ls.c and +++b/src/ls.c
So in order to get to ls.c from the current directory (coreutils-7.6)
aka .../coreutils-7.6/src/ls.c ... there is only one other folder to go into 
in order to access ls.c. So I run -p1 to "get rid" of one slash

It said 'patching file src/ls.c' then asked if I should assume -R
This asks if I should revert the last patch I attempted before...I said yes
Then it said that both hunks succeeded

Now I went back to coreutils-7.6 directory and typed 'make' to compile the
patched version

I 'cd src' in order to move to the source directory in coreutils-7.6

The only command that needed to be executed was the one involving ls.c because
that was the only file that was changed...

Then I navigated to coreutilsInstall and made an old file with
touch -t 201402200000 oldfile and indeed ls has been patched
