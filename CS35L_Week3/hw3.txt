Q1.In Brady's patch, the 'case_long_iso_time_style:' was excluded because it
was duplicated. It would fall through to the second 'case...style' case. It 
wasn't required because it was just cleaning up messy code. 

Q2. Maybe some programs / people are not accustomed to the traditional format
that we patched to. In the end, people in other countries who don't understand
this format isn't too much of an issue (it's not that hard to recognize a date)
however, programs that were built around other formats might cause bugs.

Q3. This script crashes when invoked on an empty file like /dev/null because
it cannot handle the case that it is not passed in any file that it can process
There was an index out of bounds error.

Q4. There is an error when running this python2 script with the python3
interpreter because of a syntactical difference between the two interpreters. 
The terminal said that there was an invalid syntax use at line 65 of the given
code.
