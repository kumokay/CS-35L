CS35L Spring 2015 Lab 2

/*my buildwords worked fine...but I got 50% off of the assigment cause
I simply didn't read from stdin...stupid."

A preliminary step I took was to make sure my locales were set correctly.
To do this, I typed export LC_ALL='C'

First step I took was to sort all the words from /usr/share/dict/words into a
text file in my working directory, also named words. To do this, I first 
created the text file in my working directory, then I ran the linux command
cat /usr/share/dict/words | sort > words.txt
this pipes the stdout from cat (of the /dict/words) into sort function input
and then puts that io into my words.txt

Next part of the lab, I needed to take a text file containing the HTML of this
assignment's web page and run the given commands on the lab. To do this, I use
command wget http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring15/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
Typing cat assign2.html allows me to view the html file
Now I ran several commands on this html file to see what they did:
(to see, I did cat assign2.html | (command) )

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Replaces non alphabet letters with newline

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Same thing as before but squeezed all consecutive new lines (after the first)
into the first new line...rest of text was just purely alphabetical words

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
Same thing as before but sorted alphabetically

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
Same thing as before but no repeated words

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
Compared the sorted file from before to words. Result was 3 columns, first
column with words unique to assign2.html, 2nd with words unique to words.txt
and 3rd with words shared by both files.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
Same as before but only prints the first column (only words unique to
assign2.html)

For the second part of the lab, we had to write a script to spell check
hawaiian words from the "English to Hawaiian" link given in the assignment

I wrote the script that will get all the hawaiian words from the given website

With my list of hwords given by my script, I find the misspelled hawaiian words
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u |\
comm -23 - hwords | wc
I found 413 misspelled hawaiian words

With my already created list of words, I find misspelled english words
I ran the same command as above but with hwords instead of words
I found 13 misspelled english words

Some words that are spelled right in Hawaiian but not in English are
"pehea" or "pilikua"
